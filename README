NAME
    Sub::Caller - Add caller information to @_

DESCRIPTION
    Sub::Caller provides an easy way to pass caller information to all, or
    specified, sub-routines:

       use Sub::Caller qw(all); ## Pass to all non-anon subs
       use Sub::Caller qw(sub1 sub2); ## Only these subs

       -- OR --

       use Sub::Caller;

       sub test { }

       &Sub::Caller::addCaller('test');

    The functions must be loaded before addCaller() can be called
    successfully.

    If you call addCaller() on the same function(s) multiple times, all
    calls after the first are silently ignored.

TODO
    Add some tests.

    Would be nice to add this to anonymous functions, but alas, I haven't
    figured that part out yet. Would probably have to dig into XS more and
    mess with OP code stuff.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    I just want to say that Gisle Aas' "PerlGuts Illustrated" at
    http://gisle.aas.no/perl/illguts is fantastic. It really sheds some
    light on how all those darn SVs work out. Now if only the PERL_CONTEXT
    section were finished so I knew what those were...
